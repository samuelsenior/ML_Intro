    "In Machine Learning, we're going to start nice and simple. For our first Machine Learning algorithm, we're going to create a problem and then solve it. Let's say we have some apples and oranges; not images, just textual descriptions about them, such as weight and texture. Using this information, and some previous data which we already know the answer to (i.e we know a fruit weighing 140 grams and is 'smooth' is an orange), can we predict the type of fruit if we give the classifier some textual information describing a piece of fruit?"
